While NaCL focuses on having structure to make the memory and author's notes
easily usable by players and the AI, there's a different focus when it comes to
story cards.

As story cards have a soft limit of ~1000 characters, you may need to cram a lot
of detailed information about something into a relatively small space. When you
consider the amount of space you have — only 1024 tokens (~2048 characters)
without premium — for all pieces of context (memory, author's notes, story cards,
the actual story, etc.), this limit is compounded if you have multiple triggers
for story cards active at once.

Because of this need to conserve space, back in the olden days of AI dungeon,
a lot of research was done and compiled into the
[AI Dungeon World Info Research Sheet](
	https://github.com/valahraban/AID-World-Info-research-sheet/blob/main/AID%20WI%20Research%20Sheet.md#preface
)
on various strategies to conserve space and notes on how the AI processes
context. While a lot of time has passed, meaning that the exact functionality of
the AI(s) has changed, the general findings from the research still work.

For story cards, NaCL uses general strategies from some popular formats (Zaltys
and Caveman) to provide formatted story card info that is optimized for space,
readability, and ease of use.

## Format
For story cards, NaCL follows a similar base format that it uses for writing
story memory: you have a header like `[Thing]` and each piece of information
on a line starting with a `>` and ending with a period.

For each story card, you start with a header with the name of whatever the
story card is about, and a line having the basic description of it.

For example, if we had a location called "Grassy Plains":
```
[Grassy Plains]
> Lush grassy plain; many trees.
```

For separating pieces of information on a line, you have several options:
- Comma `,`
	- Good for lists of things.
	- Example: `sword, shield, bomb.`  

	  This is pretty straightforward; it's a list of things. 
- Semicolon `;`
	- Good for a stronger separation of things in the same category.
	- Example: `lush, vibrant trees; beautiful lake; glowing fireflies.` 

	  This means that all the things listed are separate things, each being
	  a feature of some location. The semicolon implies that
	  `lush, vibrant trees` is its own thing instead of `lush` and
	  `vibrant trees` being part of a list.
- Slash `/`
	- Good as a middle ground between `,` and `;` — marks things that are
	  separate bits of information that link together under the same piece of
	  information.
	- Example: `tall/atheletic/toned.`  

	  This means that `tall`, `athletic` and `toned` come together to represent
	  the full description of someone's build.
- Ampersand `&`
	- Good when you want to group things together that should be listed with
	  an "&"/"and" between them.
	- Example: `eyes(deep&brown).`  

	  This implies that the eyes should be described as "deep and brown" or
	  the two features should be grouped together overall.

&nbsp;

*If you're not 100% sure about which one is the best to pick, it honestly
doesn't matter too much if you're stuck on very specific cases like whether to
use a slash or an ampersand to separate two things; the descriptions for
each thing are just a technical, "standard" definition for how NaCL works.*

*The AI — 99.999% of the time — isn't going to get an entirely different message
from something like `shirt(clean,white)` vs `shirt(clean&white)`.*

&nbsp;

For each following detail about the story card item, a keyword will be used
to specify what sort of information is being listed.  
Note that the keyword is put together with the `>` to help visually separate
the beginning description line from the keyword ones.  
To see the list of keywords, refer to the [keyword section](#keywords).

As an example, let's say we have someone named Jim who:
- Is a 25 year old anthropomorphic wolf male at 5'6 and 160lbs.
- Wears a white shirt, jeans, and brown boots.
- Has an average build with grey fur.
- Is depressed.
- Eats mainly pizza and salad.
- Is friends with you and someone named Naomi.
- Drops his phone when defeated.

```
[Jim]
> Anthro wolf/male/25yr/5'6/160lbs.
>WEAR white shirt, jeans, brown boots.
>APPEAR average/grey fur.
>MIND depressed.
>DIET pizza, salad.
>FRIEND you, naomi.
>LOOT phone.
```

AI Dungeon reports this as 176 characters.  
Compare this to straightforward prose, which clocks in at 340 characters:

```
Jim is a 25 year old anthro wolf male at 5'6 and 160lbs.
He wears a white shirt, jeans, and brown boots.
He has an average build with grey fur, and commonly wears a white shirt, jeans, and brown boots. Jim is suffering from depression; he mainly eats pizza and salad.
Jim is friends with you and Naomi. If defeated, Jim will drop his phone.
```

The NaCL comes *very* close to an optimized Zaltys equivalent, which has 181 characters:
```
Jim:[Anthro Wolf<Male/25y>;WEAR<Jim>:shirt<white>/jeans/boots<brown>;APPEAR<Jim>:average/fur<grey>;MIND<Jim>:depressed;DIET<Jim>:pizza/salad;FRIENDS<Jim>:you/naomi;LOOT<Jim>:phone.]
```

My testing shows that the NaCL functions similarly with the benefit of being
easier to read and write, while being slightly more condensed as well.

## Keywords

There are many keywords found and listed in the AI Dungeon World Info Research
Sheet linked at the start.  

For convenience, I have read the research sheet (and some other sources) and
compiled my own list of keywords and descriptions of their functionality;
additionally, I have separated the list into sections for keywords most suited
to story cards for entities, locations, and series info.

Despite how odd it may seem, you can generally assume that the condensed form
of a keyword functions either the same or better than the full word; this is
due to how the AI tokenizes text — despite something like `SUMM` looking like
`SUMMARY` cut off, the AI is able to extract the same meaning.

Note that this is not the be-all and end-all list of keywords.  
If you feel you have a better word for a specific kind of information, try it
out and see if the AI uses it as you want it to. If it makes sense, you can use
a keyword marked for locations/series with entities and vice-versa.  
This list is just keywords that were noted to be effective and consistent.

## Additional Options
If you wish to have slightly more technical syntax that may provide some
benefits when using NaCL, here are some optional pieces of additional syntax:

1. List grouping
	- When making lists of things, placing the list within square brackets
	  may help keep the items encapsulated together:
	  ```
	  >INV[marble, gum, slingshot].
	  ```
2. Grouped Relation
	- If you want to add a detail for a bit of info, you can use parentheses to
	  describe the detail with it:
	  ```
	  >FEATURE flowing river("azure rapids").
	  ```
	- Another example, that I use a lot:
	  ```
	  >APPE hair(long,brown)
	  >WEAR black(shirt,pants)
	  ```
	  This one is pretty effective, with the AI correctly joining "long and brown"
	  with "hair" and "black" with "shirt" and "pants".

3. Direct implication
	- You can put a colon after a keyword, which may help sell the assocation
	  between the keyword and items following it:
	  ```
	  >WEAR:white shirt/shoes/jeans
	  ```
4. Full encapsulation
	- If you're worried about the AI not associating your information with the
	  entity listed in the header, you can put brackets around everything after
	  the header to group them all together:
	  ```
	  [Steve] {
	  > Human/male/5'9.
	  >MIND energetic.
	  }
	  ```
5. Symbolic Following
	- The symbol `=>` may be used to note that something "follows" something
	  else. In Zaltys format, this was used for denoting things like directions
	  and exits they lead to:
	  ```
	  [The Dry Expanse]
	  > Hot arid desert.
	  >EXIT SW => Great Oasis; E => Endless Desolation.
	  ```

6. Multi-Word Connection
	- If you feel like a term made up of multiple words is not being grouped
	  together correctly, you can try joining the words with underscores instead
	  of spaces:
	  ```
	  [Jim]
	  > Anthro_Wolf/male/25_years/5'6_tall/160lbs.
	  >WEAR white_shirt, jeans, brown_boots
	  >APPEAR average_build/grey_fur.
	  ```
	- Another strategy is smashing words together, like `FlamingOrangeEyes` for
	  `Flaming Orange Eyes`, but this carries the risk of the AI chopping up
	  the word in a weird way and getting a different meaning, like
	  `Flamingo Range Eyes` for the example used.
	
	- Additionally, quoting something will help keep the words grouped together.

## Examples
For the purpose of helping learn how the format and keywords work, here are
several examples of story cards and their corresponding NaCL.

### Greenbriar Hills
This is an NaCL adaptation of a location example of Zaltys format from the
World Info Research
Sheet:
```
[Greenbriar Hills]
> hilly region.
>CLIM temperate.
>BIOME hilly forests; large river, East(SW from mountain).
>EXIT NW to Yrthwood; E to The Sunless Basin; SW to Teeth of Gwahlur(mountain).
>FEAT prickly plants; strange lights at night("Old Light").
>NATIVE Lizardfolk(friendly); Halflings(prosperous village "Greenbriar").
>LIFE varied; giant lizards(in river); crested birds.
>THRE wolves(minor).
```
On testing, this NaCL story card is effective like the Zaltys version, and
actually more condensed (even without full optimization) at 399 characters vs.
the 437 of the Zaltys version.

The Zaltys example, for comparison:
```
Greenbriar Hills:[ DESC: hilly_region; CLIM<Greenbriar Hills>: temperate; BIOME: hilly forests large_river:SW<from_mountain>⇒E; EXIT: <NW⇒Yrthwood> <E⇒The Sunless Basin> <SW⇒mountains:Teeth of Gwahlur>; FEATURES<Greenbriar Hills>: prickly_plants strange_lights_at_night<'Old Light'>; NATIVE: lizardfolk<friendly tribal> halflings<prosperous_village:'Greenbriar'>; LIFE: varied giant_lizards<in_river> crested_birds; THRE: wolves<minor>.]
```

### Siren
This is another example from the World Info Research Sheet, about a drink
called Siren:
```
[Siren]
> A popular drink.
>APPEAR Sapphire colored/silver bubbles/sprig of mint/smells alcoholic/tastes like rust metal.
>EFFECT Inspires drinker to dance.
```
Again, this is equivalent in effectiveness and a bit more space efficient
(156 chars vs 169).

For reference, the Zaltys example:
```
Siren:[A popular drink;DESCRIPT<Siren>:Sapphire-colored/silvery bubbles/sprig of mint/smells alcoholic/tastes like rusty metal;EFFECTS<Siren>:Inspires drinker to dance.]
```

### Mike Haggar
Another example, used when showcasing the space-optimized version of
Zaltys ("Snek"), of Mike Haggar from the Final Fight series.
This one is a fairly complex example of a character, which is why it was
used to showcase the condensed Snek format:
```
[Mike Haggar]
> Human/male/202cm/140kg.
>APPE Stocky&muscular/big arms/short_brown_hair & brown_mustache.
>MIND Just/direct/hardy/upright.
>WEAR Eyeglasses(at work)/brown_boots&green_pants/bandolier.
>SUMM Born 1943/from games Final_Fight&Street_Fighter/pro_wrestler(ex)/grew up on streets of Metro City/Mayor of Metro City/fought_gangs(Mad_Gear&Skull_Cross)/fights gangs.
>LIKE curry&rice.
>QUOTE "It's my job to keep Metro City safe!".
>FRIEND Cody&Guy&Carlos(from Brazil).
>DAUGHTER Jessica.
```

At 494 characters, this is *slightly smaller* than the optimized Snek format
version of 496 chars, which is impressive considering I actually expanded the
NaCL with more keywords to add clarity. A fully optimized NaCL could be
smaller.

For reference, the Snek version:
```
Mike Haggar:[Human<male/202cm/140kg>;APPE<Haggar>:Stocky&muscular/bigarms/brown<shorthair&mustache>;MIND<Haggar>:Just/direct/upbeat/hardy/upright;WEAR:Eyeglasses<at work>/brownboots&greenpants/bandolier;SUMM<Haggar>:Born 1943/from:<Final Fight&Street Fighter> games/ex:prowrestler/grew up on streets<in Metro City>/mayor<Metro City>/fought gangs:<Mad Gear&Skull Cross>/fights gangs/"It's my job to keep Metro City safe!"/loves:curry&rice/friends:<Cody&Guy&Carlos:from Brazil>/daughter:<Jessica>.]
```

On testing, the NaCL worked well, with Mike Haggar referencing all the details
listed for him during a conversation.
