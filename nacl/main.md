Narrative Context Language — aka NaCL ("Salt") — is something I developed
to create scenarios in a simple, consistent, and effective manner.

For AI Dungeon, you can write out your context in any way you want; however, a
structured, consistent way of formatting it makes things easier for:
- You, to write it
- Everyone, to edit it.

Over time — through use, research, and testing — I have found this format to
be effective and useful for developing and playing scenarios.  
I have continuously iterated on the design of the format, improving the
efficiency and effectiveness of it.

Overall, NaCL has been meticulously developed to optimally hit a balance of
being usable by both players and AI.

### Iodized vs Kosher

**Iodized** is the full version of NaCL, and the version I personally use when
writing my own scenarios.  
**Kosher** is based on early versions of NaCL, when it was a consistent way to
write context and not an optimized way to write it.

&nbsp;

*Are you a casual writer of scenarios? Are you simply looking for a format to
write stuff that is simple, consistent, and functional?* **Use Kosher.**

*Are you looking for something a bit more serious? Are you looking for a way to
bump up the effectiveness of your scenarios?* **Use Iodized.**

&nbsp;

Iodized is a little more technical, with a small learning curve to it, but
is designed to be as space efficient as possible while being easily usable.

Compared to just writing things in plain sentences, Iodized NaCl can reduce
the tokens taken up by your context info by 50% or more  
— this lets players, free or paid, use more story cards and/or use more of
your story at once.

To contextualize this:  
if you make it so that a free user can work with twice as much of your story
info at once, you've effectively upgraded their AI memory to what a paid user
has *for free*. 

### Historical Context

In the ancient AI Dungeon time of 2020, passionate members of the community
researched various methods of providing context and information to the AI,
with multiple formats and techniques invented.  
AI Dungeon veterans may remember these formats, such as *Zaltys* or *Caveman*.

NaCL combines ancient knowledge with modern findings to create a format
that is easier to write while being more efficient and just as powerful.
